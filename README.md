This folder contains scripts to merge journal metadat from multiple sources and
provide a snapshot for bulk importing into fatcat.

Specific bots will probably be needed to do continous updates; that's out of
scope for this first import.


## Sources

datasets.

The SHERPA/ROMEO content comes from the list helpfully munged by moreo.info.

General form here is to build a huge python dict in memory, keyed by the
ISSN-L, then write out to disk as JSON. Then the journal-metadata importer
takes a subset of fields and inserts to fatcat. Lastly, the elasticsearch
transformer takes a subset/combination of 

## ISSN-L Munging

Unfortunately, there seem to be plenty of legitimate ISSNs that don't end up in
the ISSN-L table. On the portal.issn.org public site, these are listed as:

    "This provisional record has been produced before publication of the
    resource.  The published resource has not yet been checked by the ISSN
    Network.It is only available to subscribing users."

For example:

- 2199-3246/2199-3254: Digital Experiences in Mathematics Education

Instead of just dropping these entirely, we're currently munging these by
putting the electronic or print ISSN in the ISSN-L position.
